This is a work-in-progress on making a wheel simulator with an Arduino 
leveraging its onboard timers and ultra cheap price..

Using a SparkFun Redboard (Uno clone) it's able to generate in excess of a 
32,000 RPM 60-2 crank trigger digital signal.

In theory it can go over 100,000 RPM though that needs more analysis to be 
sure the signal isn't too jittery at that level.
